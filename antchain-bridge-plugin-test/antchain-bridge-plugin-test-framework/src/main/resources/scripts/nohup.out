INFO [07-31|16:39:40.617] Starting Geth in ephemeral dev mode...
WARN [07-31|16:39:40.617] You are running Geth in --dev mode. Please note the following:

  1. This mode is only intended for fast, iterative development without assumptions on
     security or persistence.
  2. The database is created in memory unless specified otherwise. Therefore, shutting down
     your computer or losing power will wipe your entire block data and chain state for
     your dev environment.
  3. A random, pre-allocated developer account will be available and unlocked as
     eth.coinbase, which can be used for testing. The random dev account is temporary,
     stored on a ramdisk, and will be lost if your machine is restarted.
  4. Mining is enabled by default. However, the client will only seal blocks if transactions
     are pending in the mempool. The miner's minimum accepted gas price is 1.
  5. Networking is disabled; there is no listen-address, the maximum number of peers is set
     to 0, and discovery is disabled.

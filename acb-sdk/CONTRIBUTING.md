## Branch Strategy

We recommend that developers following the `Trunk-based development` rules [here](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/).

- Trunk branch `main` with stable code.
- Feature branches start with prefix `feat/`
- Release branches start with prefix `release/`
- Hotfix branches start with prefix `hotfix/` or `fix/`

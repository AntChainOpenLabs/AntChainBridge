 * An {@code IBBCService} is required in the plugin developed

 * {@code IBBCService} handles all communication requests
 * with the corresponded blockchain network. And every {@code IBBCService}
 * would register to the {@code AntChainBridgePluginManager} which is
 * part of relayer.
 *
 * <p>
 *     Developers need to implement this interface to docking
 *     your blockchain to AntChainBridge. And developers should know
 *     the follows points:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ol>
 *     <li>The implementation class must annotated with annotation {@code BBCService}. </li>
 *     <li>Only one {@code IBBCService} is supposed to be implemented in the plugin. </li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 *     All {@code IBBCService} functions are split into two
 *     interfaces {@link IAntChainBridgeDataWriter} and {@link IAntChainBridgeDataReader}.
 *     {@link IAntChainBridgeDataWriter} and {@link IAntChainBridgeDataReader} need to communicate
 *     with the blockchain network, usually through the blockchain SDK.

     *     From the actual situation, this method is usually
     *     used to initialize the SDK object of the blockchain
     *     and reload the context of a {@code IBBCService}.
     *     For example, the input {@code context} contains the configuration

     *     the SDK object of the blockchain with the {@code context}.

     *
     * <ol>
     *     <li>System contracts states like {@link com.alipay.antchain.bridge.commons.bbc.syscontract.PTCContract}, etc. </li>
     *     <li>Some configurations specific to current blockchain like the
     *     configuration to startup the SDK object. The format of this part
     *     configuration is up to developer. For example like following:
     *     <ol>
     *          <li>Network settings like blockchain nodes for connection of client, TLS certificates, etc.</li>
     *          <li>The blockchain account for this {@code IBBCService} to
     *              connect with the blockchain network. Like a private key.
     *              It's also the account of Relayer in AntChainBridge serving the blockchain.
     *              Mostly, the system contracts should be owned by this account.</li>

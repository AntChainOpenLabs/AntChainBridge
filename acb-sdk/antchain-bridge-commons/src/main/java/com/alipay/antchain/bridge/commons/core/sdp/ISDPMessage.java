/**
 * Interface {@code ISDPMessage} defines all methods for the SDP
 * message object.
 *
 * <p>
 *      Smart-contract Datagram Protocol, SDP in short, provides the
 *      crosschain communication ability between contracts on different
 *      blockchains. The SDP contract is supposed to pre-deployed on each
 *      blockchain involved in crosschain network. During the communication
 *      processing, SDP contracts pack the message from sender contract into
 *      SDP packet and sink the raw packet bytes into AM packet. After
 *      ACB network relaying the cross-chain message onto receiving blockchain,
 *      the SDP contract on receiving blockchain would unpack the SDP packet
 *      and deliver the message from sender contract to the identified
 *      receiver contract.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     SDP now provides two versions of implementations, version one and two.
 *     Version one provides ability to sending ordered or unordered messages
 *     to another contract. And version two offer the atomic type message sending
 *     to another contract expecting multiple type acknowledge responses
 *     in different situations. And version two is good at preventing replay attacks.
 * </p>
